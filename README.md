This is the "Clone Project" of Flipkart Application . I have use JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, HTML and CSS to make it a functional clone a bit similar to Flipkart website. 
The project has major working specification like Search bar is in working condition Search bar passes the queries to handle function which renders the ui based on text entered in the Search bar, The items can be rendered by fetch function ,it fetches the items from server ,Server's data is passed by backend items.json file . 
In the Home page there are "Add-to-cart" buttons after clicking on these buttons products passed to cart component and will print the cart UI. The Search bar is also in the working condition.
